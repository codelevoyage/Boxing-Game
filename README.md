# Boxing Game

This project simulates a simple boxing game between two players where they take turns hitting each other until one is knocked out.

## What I Learned
- **Conditional Logic**: Used `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to categorize damage and manage player health.
- **Git Directory Structure**: Learned how to properly manage directories and add files to Git.

## How to Play
Run the game with `node boxing.js` in the terminal.
